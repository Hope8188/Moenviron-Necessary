# Project Constitution: Print-Palooza (Moenviron)

## Core Mission
To build a world-class, sustainable e-commerce platform that empowers communities in East Africa and reduces textile waste through a circular economy.

## Technical Standards (UI/UX Pro Max)
1. **Aesthetics**: Premium, high-end designs. No "boring white walls." Use Glassmorphism, Aurora UI, and Linear-style dark modes.
2. **Performance**: Optimize critical paths. Aim for < 80ms interaction latency where possible.
3. **Architecture**: Clean, modular code. Use the BLAST framework for all major features.
4. **Payment**: Stripe-exclusive for secure, global transactions. No legacy or secondary gateways.

## The BLAST Methodology
- **Blueprint**: Initialize memory with `task_plan.md`.
- **Link**: Ensure all integrations (Supabase, Resend, MailerLite) are securely connected.
- **Architect**: Map out data flows and component hierarchy before coding.
- **Style**: Apply micro-interactions, border beams, and staggered reveals.
- **Trigger**: Deploy with clear checklists and automated verification.

## The SWARM Protocol
- Break complex missions into right-sized tasks.
- Parallelize work across specialized sub-agents.
- Continuous validation and merging.

## Operational Directives
- **Pareto Principle**: Focus on the 20% of effort that yields 80% of results.
- **Deep Thinking**: Analyze problems to their fundamentals (First Principles).
- **Token Efficiency**: Optimize context usage. Summarize, don't just dump.
- **Security First**: Secrets belong in `.env` or Supabase Secrets, never hardcoded (unless emergency fallback is documented).

## Development Vibe
Innovative, proactive, and "Unicorn" grade. We don't just fix bugs; we evolve the system.
